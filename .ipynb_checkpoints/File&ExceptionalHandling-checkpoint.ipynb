    "# Lightweight: Threads share the same memory space, reducing overhead and improving performance for tasks that involve frequent data sharing.\n",
    "# Easier to manage: Thread creation and synchronization are generally simpler than their multiprocessing counterparts.\n",
    "# Suitable for I/O-bound tasks: Threads can effectively handle tasks that involve a lot of input/output operations (e.g., reading from files, network communication), as the operating system can switch between threads while waiting for I/O to complete.\n",
    "# Good for CPU-bound tasks with limited parallelism: If a CPU-bound task can be divided into subtasks that can be executed concurrently, multithreading can provide a performance boost. However, for highly CPU-bound tasks with significant parallelism, multiprocessing might be more suitable.\n",
